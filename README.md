Project Euler in Q and K
================

This is my attempt to solve as many problems from the website 
https://projecteuler.net/ using the language K and its subset Q,
from Kx Systems. Q is a purely syntactic wrapper on top of k,
a single k script in fact, so the translation is mostly 1-to-1.

For the simpler problems I will start by using K as it is more of a
challenge, before converting it to Q. Multi-block code will be done 
in Q and then converted to K. Certain issues may arise when 
translating between Q and K, and they will be pointed out in the 
comments of the script.

The aim of this is to aid my learning of Q and K for my final year 
project at university (of which the source code will be available 
after I hand it in), and through doing so I hope to aid others in
learning the language.
